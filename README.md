## Synopsis

Seat guests for an event according to their relationships

Each event guest may form opinions of other guests - guests they like or dislike.  Seating indicates when a guest would be happy or unhappy with their current seat based on their opinions with their neighbors

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
